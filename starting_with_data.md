Question 1: Is there a linear relationship between the revenue generated by a product and it's sentiment score and sentiment magnitude?

SQL Queries:

```SQL
SELECT name, 
	SUM(revenue) AS "Total Revenue", 
	sentimentscore, 
	sentimentmagnitude 
FROM analytics2 anal 
JOIN all_sessions alls ON anal.fullvisitorid = alls.fullvisitorid
JOIN products pr ON alls.productsku = pr.sku
WHERE revenue IS NOT null
GROUP BY name, sentimentscore, sentimentmagnitude
ORDER BY SUM(revenue) DESC
```

Answer: 

Suprisingly sentimentscore and total revenue do not have  a linear relationship in our dataset. The 2nd highest revenue generator, the 7" Dog Frisbee has the lowest sentiment score at -0.6. 

Question 2: What sentiment score corresponds to the most revenue generated? Is the relationship meaningful?

SQL Queries:

```SQL
SELECT sentimentscore,
	SUM(revenue) AS "Total Revenue"  
FROM analytics2 anal 
JOIN all_sessions alls ON anal.fullvisitorid = alls.fullvisitorid
JOIN products pr ON alls.productsku = pr.sku
WHERE revenue IS NOT null
GROUP BY sentimentscore
ORDER BY SUM(revenue) DESC
```

Answer:

The products that were the highest revenue generators had a sentiment score of 0.2.  The highest sentiment score (0.9) corresponded to the 11th highest revenue out of 16.  A product's sentiment score is not indicative of it being a revenue generator.

Question 3: Which month in 2017 was the most revenue generated? Does the results reveal anything about the data set?

SQL Queries:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS "Month", 
	SUM(revenue) AS "Monthly Revenue"
FROM analytics2 
GROUP BY "Month"
```

Answer:

The most revenue was generated in July 2017.  The data set only has revenue data for May, June, July and August of 2017 and the revenue in August is significantly lower than the June or July Revenue.  The results suggest that the revenue data is very incomplete.

Question 4: Which channelling group brings in the most revenue?

SQL Queries:

```SQL
SELECT distinct channelgrouping,
	SUM(revenue) AS "Revenue"
FROM analytics2
WHERE channelgrouping != '(Other)'
GROUP BY channelgrouping
ORDER BY "Revenue" DESC
```

Answer:

The most revenue was generated through the deferral channel group, second most from direct and third most from organic searching. Revenue  drops of pretty significantly after that and then we have display, paid search, affiliates and social in last place.

Question 5: Is Time on Site a meaningful metric when it comes to making a purchase?

SQL Queries:

``` SQL
SELECT AVG(timeonsite)
FROM analytics2 anal
WHERE revenue IS NOT null

SELECT AVG(timeonsite)
FROM analytics2 anal
WHERE revenue IS null
```

Answer:

Yes, time on site is a significant metirc for if a consumer is going to buy a product.  The average time a consumer spend on site before making a purchase was 1221 seconds. The time spent on site when there was no logged revenue was 690 seconds.
